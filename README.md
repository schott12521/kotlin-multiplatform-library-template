# What is this?

Template repo that I use for creating kotlin-multiplatform libraries that publish to github, hopefully soon to maven. This repo supports iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop targets.

Additionally, there's an example application that depends on the library.

## Usage

Copy this template from Github, then pull the repo and start working locally.

I'd suggest a few things from the get go:

- Replace all `TODO CHANGE` with correct values
- Ensure that github actions are setup / enabled for the new repo, ensure gha has permissions to manipulate packages
